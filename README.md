# CodeAlpha_Event_Registration_System
 This project is an Event Registration System built with Django for the backend and PostgreSQL for the database. It provides API endpoints to list events, display event details, and handle user registrations. Users can register for events, view their registrations, and cancel them if needed, enabling smooth and efficient event management.

Additionally, the system includes an optional admin panel for event organizers to securely add, update, or delete events. Authentication ensures that only authorized organizers can manage event details. The frontend is built using HTML and CSS, providing a clean and user-friendly interface for both attendees and admins. This system is ideal for colleges, corporate trainings, and community event registrations.
